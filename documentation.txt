in app.js (This is a React functional component called "App" that uses the hooks useEffect and useState to create a recipe search app. It utilizes the Edamam recipe search API to search for and display recipes based on a query.

The component starts by defining the APP_ID and APP_KEY constants, which are used to access the API, as well as two state variables recipes and search which are used to store the data returned by the API and the search query respectively.

The useEffect hook is used to fetch the data from the API when the component first renders, and whenever the query state variable changes. It calls the getRecipes function, which sends a GET request to the API, passing the query as a parameter and stores the data in the recipes state variable.

The component also has two functions: updateSearch and getSearch, which are used to update the search state variable when the user types into the search bar and handle the form submission to send the query to the API, respectively.

Finally, the component renders a form with a search bar and a submit button, and a div element that displays the returned recipes by mapping over the recipes state variable and passing the data to the Recipe component, which then renders the individual recipe.)

in recipe.js(
    This is a functional component called "Recipe" that takes in four props from its parent component "App" as an argument : title, calories, image, and ingredients.

It's using the destructuring assignment to extract the props passed to it.

It then returns JSX that renders the recipe's title, a list of ingredients, the calories, and the image.

The component uses the .map() method to iterate over the ingredients prop and display each ingredient in a li element.

It also uses the src attribute of the img element to render the image passed as the image prop and an alt attribute is used to provide an alternative description of the image in case the image can't be loaded.

It also uses the className attribute to apply the CSS class from a CSS module to the JSX elements. The CSS module is imported at the top of the file and is used to style the component.
